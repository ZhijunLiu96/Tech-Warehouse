# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications <a id="chapter1"> </a>

### Reliability

**Definition**

- The application performs the function that the user expected.
- It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.
- Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume.
- The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.


**Faults**

- Hardware Faults: use redundant component to solve the problem
- Software Errors: bug causes all instances crash; a runaway process uses up CPU, memory, disk space or network bandwidth; a service slow down, unresponsive, or corrupt responses; cascading failures, a small fault triggers other failures
- Human Errors
